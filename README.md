# Pixi lab

This is a bare-bones starting point for web development upon the following building blocks:

- Webpack 5
- Typescript 4.5
- Pixi.js 6

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- Navigate into the new directory
- Run `npm install`

## Local development

- Run `npm start`
- Open `localhost:8000` in a web browser
- Make changes starting at `src/index.ts`

The app will reload when source code changes are saved and rebuilt. Press CTRL-C in the terminal to stop the dev server.
